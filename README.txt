This code is defining multiple variables using the document.getElementById method to retrieve elements from the HTML document. These variables represent various elements within the webpage that will be used later on in the script.

The code then retrieves the html and body elements and sets their widths and heights to the viewport dimensions. It then initializes an empty players array.

The script adds an event listener to the playerCountBtn element that will execute a function when clicked. This function checks if the user has entered a number between 1 and 4 into the playerCountInput element. If the value is valid, the function creates a number of input elements based on the user input, and a "Start Game" button.

The "Start Game" button also has an event listener that checks whether all the input fields have been filled out, and if so, hides the setup element, shows the game element, and creates a table with the player names in the thead element. The function also calls the updateScoreboard() function and addNewRow() function.

The addNewRow() function is defined to add a new row to the tbody element, representing a new turn in the game. The function also adds a button to each cell in the row. When the button is clicked, the updateCell() function is called.

The nextTurnBtn element has an event listener that adds a new row to the table when clicked.

The definitionBtn element has an event listener that calls the getWord() function with the value of the wordBox element.
